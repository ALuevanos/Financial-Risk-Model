# Financial-Risk-Model   

## 📌 Overview  
This machine learning model predicts whether a person will successfully repay a loan or fail to pay it back.
It helps banks, lenders, and financial institutions decide who is more likely to make their payments on time and who might miss payments or not repay at all, reducing financial risk.

## 🧠 Models Used  
✅ **Decision Tree** 🌲 (Basic rule-based model)  
✅ **Random Forest** 🌳🌳🌳 (Better generalization, reduces overfitting)  
✅ **Gradient Boosting** 🚀 (Most accurate, best performance)  

## 🎯 Key Results

🔹 **Best Model:** **Gradient Boosting** (Most accurate & generalizes well).  
🔹 **Use Case:** Can help **banks approve or reject loans fairly** and **reduce financial risk**.
